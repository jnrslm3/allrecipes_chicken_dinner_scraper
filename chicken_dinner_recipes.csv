1 (4 pound) chicken, cut into pieces


1 cup buttermilk


2 cups all-purpose flour for coating


1 teaspoon paprika


  salt and pepper to taste


2 quarts vegetable oil for frying

","

 Take your cut up chicken pieces and skin them if you prefer.




 Put the flour in a large plastic bag (let the amount of chicken you are cooking dictate the amount of flour you use). Season the flour with paprika, salt and pepper to taste (paprika helps to brown the chicken).

 





 
 Dotdash Meredith Food Studios




 Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk then, a few at a time, put them in the bag with the flour, seal the bag and shake to coat well.

 





 
 Dotdash Meredith Food Studios




 Place the coated chicken on a cookie sheet or tray, and cover with a clean dish towel or waxed paper. LET SIT UNTIL THE FLOUR IS OF A PASTE-LIKE CONSISTENCY. THIS IS CRUCIAL!

 





 
 Dotdash Meredith Food Studios




 Fill a large skillet (cast iron is best) about 1/3 to 1/2 full with vegetable oil. Heat until VERY hot.




 Put in as many chicken pieces as the skillet can hold. Brown the chicken in HOT oil on both sides.

 





 
 Dotdash Meredith Food Studios




 When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let cook for 30 minutes (the chicken will be cooked through but not crispy). Remove cover, raise heat again, and continue to fry until crispy.




 Drain the fried chicken on paper towels. Depending on how much chicken you have, you may have to fry in a few shifts. Keep the finished chicken in a slightly warm oven while preparing the rest.

 Dotdash Meredith Food Studios




 Once all of the chicken has been fried, refry the chicken, starting with the batch that was cooked first. Fry each batch until chicken turns deep golden brown, about 2 minutes more. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.




 Prepare sauce: Heat vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Stir in green onion, garlic, whole chiles, and orange zest. Cook and stir until garlic turns golden and chiles brighten, 1 to 2 minutes.

 





 
 Dotdash Meredith Food Studios




 Add sugar, soy sauce, chicken broth, peanut oil, rice vinegar, sesame oil, and ginger; bring to a boil and cook for 3 minutes. Whisk 2 teaspoons of cornstarch in water until dissolved. Stir into the boiling sauce. Return to a boil and cook until the sauce thickens and is no longer cloudy from the cornstarch, about 1 minute.

 





 
 Dotdash Meredith Food Studios




 Stir chicken into the boiling sauce. Reduce heat to low and cook until chicken is heated through and has absorbed some of the sauce, about 3 minutes.

The Best Chicken Fried Steak,4.5,"(1,515)","This chicken fried steak recipe is one I received from a co-worker about 5 years ago. A Southern favorite, these crispy, breaded, tenderized cube steaks drenched in creamy gravy can be served for breakfast or dinner. It's by far the best chicken fried steak I've ever had. I've made this numerous times for my picky son and my Southern-raised better half, as well as for other family and friends and each time, I get nothing but rave reviews.","

 Dotdash Meredith Food Studios




 Heat shortening in a deep cast-iron skillet to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place a wire rack over a sheet of parchment paper.




 While the shortening is heating, dredge a steak in flour to coat; shake off excess. Dip into buttermilk batter; lift up so excess batter drips back into the bowl. Press in flour again to coat both sides completely. Place breaded steak on the wire rack and repeat to bread remaining steaks.

 





 
 Dotdash Meredith Food Studios




 Fry steaks, in batches if necessary, until evenly golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Remove steaks to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Cover with foil to keep warm while you make the gravy.

 





 
 Dotdash Meredith Food Studios




 Drain fat from the skillet, reserving 1/4 cup of the liquid and as much of the solid remnants as possible.




 Return the skillet to medium-low heat; add the reserved oil. Whisk the remaining 1/4 cup flour into the oil. Scrape the bottom of the pan with a spatula to release solids into the gravy.

 





 
 Dotdash Meredith Food Studios




 Stir in milk, increase the heat to medium, and bring the gravy to a simmer. Cook, stirring often, until thick, 6 to 7 minutes. Season with kosher salt and pepper.

1 tablespoon softened butter


¼ cup teriyaki sauce


2 slices Swiss cheese


2 tablespoons mayonnaise


2 slices pineapple


2 slices tomato


2  slices of iceberg lettuce

","

 Place chicken breasts into a plastic zipper bag with soy sauce, seal the bag, and marinate in refrigerator for 30 minutes. While chicken is marinating, place bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, occasionally turning until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate, and set aside. Spread cut sides of hamburger buns with butter.




 Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.




 Remove chicken from soy sauce, and discard excess soy sauce. Place chicken breasts onto the preheated grill, and grill until chicken shows good grill marks, is no longer pink inside, and juices run clear, 4 to 5 minutes per side. When chicken is almost done, brush each piece generously on both sides with teriyaki sauce to finish grilling. Place a slice of Swiss cheese on each chicken breast, and cover with a lid to help cheese melt onto chicken.




 While chicken is grilling, spread buns open on the grill and cook until toasted and showing grill lines, about 2 minutes. Set buns aside.




 To assemble, spread grilled sides of each bun with mayonnaise, and top each bottom bun with a cooked chicken breast, 1 1/2 slices of bacon, a slice of pineapple, a slice from a head of lettuce, a slice of tomato, and top bun.

 Remove chicken meat from the carcass and add to the stock. Season with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper to taste. Continue simmering for 10 to 15 minutes.




 Whisk creme fraiche, milk, 2 teaspoons of thyme leaves, and eggs together in a large bowl. Stir in self-rising flour until almost entirely incorporated; do not overmix.




 Scoop large dollops of dumpling mixture on top of the chicken stock. Increase heat slightly to medium-high. Cover and simmer until dumplings appear light and fluffy, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 10 to 15 minutes. Serve garnish with thyme sprigs.

Roast Sticky Chicken-Rotisserie Style,4.7,"(4,540)","Rotisserie chicken seasoning makes the most flavorful whole chicken. Ever wish you could get that restaurant-style rotisserie chicken at home?

Prosciutto-Wrapped Cherry-Stuffed Chicken Breasts,4.6,(118),"This stuffed, prosciutto-wrapped chicken breast has everything you want in a Valentine's Day entrée. It looks fancy, tastes amazing, and contains dried cherries, a known aphrodisiac.","

1 tablespoon vegetable oil

1 teaspoon fresh thyme


1 teaspoon fresh oregano, minced


  salt and pepper to taste


1 pinch cayenne pepper


2 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves


4 thin slices  prosciutto


¾ cup chicken broth


1 ½ tablespoons balsamic vinegar


1 tablespoon butter

","

 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Brush the inside of an ovenproof skillet with vegetable oil. Set aside.




 Mix together cherries, bread crumbs, egg yolk, olive oil, garlic, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, thyme, oregano, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a large bowl until stuffing is combined.




 Cut a 1-inch slit in each chicken breast by slicing at an angle from the thick end of the breast toward the thinner end.




 Open flap and place one butterflied chicken breast between 2 sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well, too) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2 inch. Repeat with the other breast.




 Place each breast on a piece of plastic wrap, divide stuffing evenly between each breast, and roll into a tight roll, twisting the ends of the plastic wrap to create a tight package.




 On a piece of plastic wrap, slightly overlap 2 slices prosciutto so they are as wide as the rolled chicken breast. Unwrap rolled chicken breast and place breast at one end of prosciutto. Roll prosciutto around stuffed breast using the plastic to make a tight roll. Repeat with second stuffed breast and remaining 2 slices prosciutto.




 Lay 4 pieces of string on a cutting board, about 1-inch apart. Place a chicken roll across the strings and tie each into a knot to keep chicken from unrolling. Repeat with second stuffed breast.




 Place stuffed, rolled chicken breasts in the prepared skillet and bake in the preheated oven until prosciutto is browned and crispy and chicken is no longer pink, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken to a plate and loosely cover with aluminum foil.




 Drain grease from the skillet as desired, leaving juice and browned bits. Pour in chicken broth and balsamic vinegar; bring to a boil. Cook, scraping the browned bits from the bottom of the pan, until liquid is reduced by half, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove from heat, add butter, and stir until melted. Season with salt and black pepper.




 Remove the twine from chicken; slice into bite-sized pieces. Serve drizzled with sauce.

 Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place a baking sheet on the a rack on which you'll bake the pie.




 Combine the carrots, celery, peas, green beans, corn, onion, red potatoes, and chicken broth in a large pot. Season the vegetable mixture with thyme, salt, and black pepper; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes. Drain the vegetables and set aside.




 Place dry chicken gravy mix into another saucepan and gradually whisk in the water until smooth. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until thickened, about 1 minute. Set gravy aside and allow to continue to thicken as it cools.




 Press one of the pie crusts into the bottom of a 9-inch pie dish. Spoon a layer of gravy (about 1/3 cup) into the crust. Layer the cooked vegetables and shredded chicken into the crust until the filling is level with the top of the pie dish. Pour the rest of the gravy slowly over the filling until gravy is visible at the top. Scatter butter pieces over the filling; top with second crust. Seal the 2 crusts together and crimp with a fork.




 Whisk the egg and milk together in a bowl, and brush the egg wash over the top crust. Pierce the top crust several times to vent steam.




 Bake the pot pie in the preheated oven until the filling is bubbling and the crust is golden brown, about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Check periodically to see if the edge of the crust is browning too quickly; if needed, cover the edge with a strip of aluminum foil to prevent over-browning.
